Lydia Ko concluded the CME Group Tour Championship with a final-round 68 
that had some amazing numbers. She hit 21 of 22 greens in regulation and 
18 of 18 fairways on Sunday (including four playoff holes). 

She totaled 107 putts (first in the field) for the week through 72 holes, 
with 26, 26 and 24 in the first three rounds before her ball-striking improved 
on Sunday (31 putts). 

She also played the final 24 holes without a bogey (last two holes of the third 
round and all of Sunday) in finishing 68-68 on the weekend.

Ko has never missed a cut in 42 career LPGA starts, with finishes in the top 10 
52 percent of the time and in the top 25 for 75 percent of her starts. 
Her worst career finish was a T61 at this year¡¯s Kia Classic where she shot 
a final-round 78.
